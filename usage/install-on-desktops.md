# Ubuntu/Debian Based Install Instructions

## Installation

These instructions work for ubuntu focal, ubuntu hirsute, debian bullseye, droidian, ubports, and likely more. We will continue to update this document as the project further develops

### Install Pre-requisites

```bash
sudo apt install curl -y
```

Waydroid requires the following in order to work properly on your PC:

* python3
* lxc
* curl
* Wayland session manager _**IMPORTANT!!**_

> _**NOTES**:_
>
> * ⚠️  NVIDIA GPUs do not work as of now, try using iGPU of your CPU or software rendering instead.
> * _**Wayland session manager**_ comes with distros running GNOME by default \(Ubuntu, Pop!\_OS, Fedora, etc\), so no need to install separately.
> * Other desktop environments/window managers, might not support Wayland out of the box. \(KDE Plasma does after 5.21\)

### Install Waydroid

Add the repo to your `sources.list`

* **Add waydroid repo** _\(for droidian & ubports, this step can be skipped\)_ Replace `DISTRO="bullseye"` with your current target. Options: **focal**, **bullseye**, **hirsute**

```bash
export DISTRO="bullseye" && \
sudo curl -# --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -Sf https://repo.waydro.id/waydroid.gpg --output /usr/share/keyrings/waydroid.gpg && \
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/waydroid.gpg] https://repo.waydro.id/ $DISTRO main" > ~/waydroid.list && \
sudo mv ~/waydroid.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/waydroid.list && \
sudo apt update
```

**install Waydroid:**

```bash
sudo apt install waydroid -y
```

**And start the init process:**

```bash
sudo waydroid init
```

**Then start the waydroid container service \(or just simply reboot\):**

```bash
sudo systemctl start waydroid-container
```

## Troubleshooting

### Manually Starting Waydroid

To start Waydroid without systemctl, you need to follow a few simple steps

**Start the container first:**

```bash
sudo waydroid container start
```

**And in a new terminal tab, start the waydroid session \(without** _**sudo**_**\):**

```bash
waydroid session start
```

After that starts and you see "Android with user 0 is ready", it is safe to launch an app from the applications menu, or

### Launch Waydroid In Full-Screen Mode:

_\(This can be run while Waydroid is running, or used to start it in full-screen mode\)_

```bash
waydroid show-full-ui
```

### Launch Waydroid In Multi-Window Mode:

First we need to set the property while a Waydroid session is running:

```bash
waydroid prop set persist.waydroid.multi_windows true
```

After that, we can restart the container:

```text
sudo systemctl restart waydroid-container
```

Then we are ready to launch an app, and it will start in multi-window mode

## Reinstalling Waydroid

Sometimes things don't go as planned and you need to remove it all and start over. To do that, follow the steps below:

First, make sure you have stopped the session and containers:

```bash
waydroid session stop
sudo waydroid container stop
```

Then it is safe to remove Waydroid:

```bash
sudo apt remove waydroid
```

After you remove Waydroid, reboot.

Then once logged back in, we need to do a little cleanup:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/waydroid /home/.waydroid ~/waydroid ~/.share/waydroid ~/.local/share/applications/waydroid.* ~/.local/share/applications/Waydroid.desktop ~/.local/share/waydroid
```

Then can reinstall and run the init command again:

```bash
sudo apt install waydroid
sudo waydroid init
```
